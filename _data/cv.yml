    - title: Micro-video Understanding and Analysis
      items: 
        - In the context of the rapid development of the micro-video industry, research focuses on the core problem of micro-video semantic analysis, gradually expanding the research from the prediction of the popularity of multimodal micro-videos, the detection of micro-video events, the classification of multimodal micro-videos, and the prediction of micro-video memorability.
    - title: Image/video Memorability Modelling
      items:
        - Semantic analysis is a key and difficult problem in high-level cognition in visual understanding. The focus of the research is to solve the semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts. Currently, research on classic media data represented by images is gradually focusing on high-level abstract semantic concepts. Starting from representation learning, research is conducted in areas such as sentiment analysis of multimedia data, memorability analysis, and compatibility prediction of fashionable multimedia.

      items:
        - The rapid growth of data volume and diverse data types bring new challenges to the development of the multimedia field. In order to better solve the context, temporal smoothness, and higher-order problems in temporal data, through in-depth research on the temporal patterns of data under the framework of tensor decomposition and deep learning, and through adaptive learning, the temporal correlation patterns of data are obtained.
